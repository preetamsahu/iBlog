      <h3>Now read about me</h3>
      <p>
        Allow me to introduce myselfâ€”I am Preetam Sahu, a dynamic individual
        whose roots lie in the culturally rich tapestry of Chhattisgarh.
        Charting my academic journey, I successfully earned a BTech in Computer
        Science from the esteemed 2019-2023 batch. However, my academic
        accolades extend beyond the conventional, as I proudly secured the 239th
        rank in the GATE-CSE examination, a testament to my dedication and
        intellectual prowess.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Embarking on the crossroads of academia and industry, I found myself
        standing at the intersection of two compelling opportunities. On one
        hand, I was invited to contribute to the academic legacy of IIT Bombay
        as a Computer Science Teaching Assistant (CS-TA). On the other, the
        corporate allure beckoned with an enticing offer from Powergrid PSU.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Choosing a path aligned with innovation and societal impact, I made the
        decision to harness my potential within the dynamic realm of Powergrid.
        The juxtaposition of opportunities from IIT Bombay and Powergrid created
        a narrative of choice, one that I embraced with enthusiasm. Currently, I
        am navigating the complexities of the corporate landscape in the role of
        an Engineer Trainee CS at Powergrid, a position I undertook with zeal on
        the 31st of July 2023.
      </p>
      <p>
        My professional journey serves as a testament to the harmonious blend of
        academic excellence and practical application. I am more than a mere
        observer of the dynamic realm of Powergrid; I am an active participant,
        driven by the relentless pursuit of success and a commitment to
        transforming dreams into tangible accomplishments. As I continue this
        odyssey, I aspire to be a guiding light for those who share the audacity
        to dream and the determination to turn those dreams into reality.
