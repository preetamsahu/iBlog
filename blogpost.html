          Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of
          instructions, called programs, that computers can follow to perform
          tasks.[1][2] It involves designing and implementing algorithms,
          step-by-step specifications of procedures, by writing code in one or
          more programming languages. Programmers typically use high-level
          programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than
          machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing
          unit. Proficient programming usually requires expertise in several
          different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
          details of programming languages and generic code libraries,
          specialized algorithms, and formal logic. Auxiliary tasks accompanying
          and related to programming include analyzing requirements, testing,
          debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build
          systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as programs'
          machine code. While these are sometimes considered programming, often
          the term software development is used for this larger overall process
          – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for
          the writing and editing of code per se. Sometimes software development
          is known as software engineering, especially when it employs formal
          methods or follows an engineering design process

          For disciplines in which a qualitative format is preferential,
          including ethnography, humanistic geography or phenomenological
          psychology a varied approach to coding can be applied. Iain Hay (2005)
          outlines a two-step process beginning with basic coding in order to
          distinguish overall themes, followed by a more in depth, interpretive
          code in which more specific trends and patterns can be interpreted.[2]
          Much of qualitative coding can be attributed to either grounded or a
          priori coding.[3] Grounded coding refers to allowing notable themes
          and patterns emerge from the document themselves, where as a priori
          coding requires the researcher to apply pre-existing theoretical
          frameworks to analyze the documents. As coding methods are applied
          across various texts, the researcher is able to apply axial coding,
          which is the process of selecting core thematic categories present in
          several documents to discover common patterns and relations.[4] Coding
          is considered a process of discovery and is done in cycles. Prior to
          constructing categories, a researcher might apply a first and second
          cycle coding methods.[3] There are a multitude of methods available,
          and a researcher will want to pick one that is suited for the format
          and nature of their documents. Not all methods can be applied to every
          type of document. Some examples of first cycle coding methods include:
          In Vivo Coding: codes terms and phrases used by the participants
          themselves. The objective is to attempt to give the participants a
          voice in the research. Process Coding: this method uses gerunds
          ("-ing" words) only to describe and display actions throughout the
          document. It is useful for examining processes, emotional phases and
          rituals. Versus Coding: uses binary terms to describe groups and
          processes. The goal is to see which processes and organizations are in
          conflict with each other throughout the document. These can be both
          conceptual and grounded objects. Values Coding: codes that attempt to
          exhibit the inferred values, attitudes and beliefs of participants. In
          doing so, the research may discern patterns in world views.
          Sub-coding: Other names of this method are embedded coding, nested
          coding or joint coding. This involves assigning primary and second
          order codes to a word or phrase. It serves the purpose of adding
          detail to a code. The primary and secondary codes are often called
          parent and children codes.[5] Simultaneous Coding: When same parts of
          the data have different meanings and two or more codes are applied to
          the same parts, then this kind of coding is called Simultaneous
          Coding.[3] The process can be done manually, which can be as simple as
          highlighting different concepts with different colours, or fed into a
          software package. Some examples of qualitative software packages
          include Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, QDA Miner, and RQDA. After assembling
          codes it is time to organize them into broader themes and categories.
          The process generally involves identifying themes from the existing
          codes, reducing the themes to a manageable number, creating
          hierarchies within the themes and then linking themes together through
          theoretical modeling.[6]

          You are here: Home / What is Coding? What is Coding? You’ve seen the
          craze for learning code. But what exactly is coding? Coding is what
          makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and
          websites. Your browser, your OS, the apps on your phone, Facebook, and
          this website – they’re all made with code. Here’s a simple example of
          code, written in the Python language: print 'Hello, world!' Many
          coding tutorials use that command as their very first example, because
          it’s one of the simplest examples of code you can have – it ‘prints’
          (displays) the text ‘Hello, world!’ onto the screen. Coding 101 If you
          don’t know the first thing about coding, you’ve come to the right
          place. We’ve put together a beginner’s tutorial which will give you
          all the background information you need on coding, before you start
          learning it for real. It starts with an explanation on the benefits of
          learning coding. Here, you’ll find out what you’ll be able to do once
          you know how to work with code. Then, you’ll get a deeper
          understanding of how coding works, and how the code you write gets
          converted into an instruction that a computer can ‘understand’. Very
          satisfying to know! That’s followed by an outline of today’s coding
          languages. After all, every language has a purpose – some are for the
          web, others for app development, others for desktop software. You’ll
          find out why web development is an ideal form of coding to start off
          with, and then get a full overview of it. You’ll also be introduced to
          web design and app development. Finally – and most importantly –
          there’s a step-by-step action plan that will outline the fastest and
          easiest way to get started in coding, and become a coder in 6 months.
